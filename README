INSTALLING
	Run sh autogen.sh to install the autotools files,
	./configure
	make
	make install (or just run ./jkutop)

WHY?
	I'm a sysadmin of a large SMP system. The performance of
	top from procps on such a machine (usually running around 30000
	processes, lot of which potentially run hundreds of threads) caused
	user complaints. Figuring out how top works in order to speed it up
	had me writing code to replicate parts of the functionality, and
	then some more, until it snowballed into a fairly practicable clone
	of top. It is essentially an internal tool with features my
	colleagues and I find nifty and useful.
